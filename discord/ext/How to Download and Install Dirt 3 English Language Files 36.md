## What are some tips for playing Dirt 3?
 
If you want to improve your performance and enjoy Dirt 3 more, here are some tips that might help you:

- Practice makes perfect. The best way to learn the tracks, the cars and the controls is to practice as much as you can. You can use the free roam mode in the Battersea Compound to test your car and practice your skills. You can also use the rewind feature to correct your mistakes and try again.
- Listen to your co-driver. In rally events, you will have a co-driver who will read you pacenotes that tell you what kind of turns and hazards are ahead of you. Pay attention to their instructions and follow them as closely as possible. They will help you navigate the course faster and safer.
- Use the right car for the right event. Different cars have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the mode, the terrain and the weather. For example, a four-wheel drive car will perform better on gravel or snow than a rear-wheel drive car. A powerful car will be faster on straight roads than a nimble car. A light car will be easier to handle than a heavy car. Experiment with different cars and find the ones that suit your style and preference.
- Adjust your settings. Dirt 3 allows you to tweak various settings to suit your needs and preferences. You can change the camera angle, the steering sensitivity, the brake bias, the traction control, the stability control and more. You can also turn on or off various HUD elements, such as speedometer, timer, map and damage indicator. Find the settings that work best for you and make you comfortable.
- Have fun. Dirt 3 is a game that lets you express yourself and have fun with racing. You can perform stunts, drifts, jumps and spins in gymkhana events or freestyle mode. You can smash objects, crash into opponents or use power-ups in party mode. You can also create your own events and share them with other players. Don't be afraid to try new things and experiment with different options.
